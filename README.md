# Roman | Java & Python Developer
Java developer focusing on backend systems and practical AI integrations.

### What I'm currently working on
Most of my active work is in private repositories while I prepare clean, public-ready versions. Current projects include:

- [**CorporationX** ](https://github.com/CorporationX)
  A public multi-service application (9 microservices) built with Java/Spring for managing startup workflows.  
  I’m actively contributing to the project; some of the features I’m working on are currently in progress and not yet merged.

- [**AI Assistant Bot**](https://github.com/RecursiveCat/AI-Assistant-Bot)  
  Telegram assistant integrating LLM APIs (OpenAI, LangChain).  
  The project is currently private while I finalize the initial structure and prepare a public version.

- [**Tandem Bot**](https://github.com/RecursiveCat/Tandem-ToDo-TgBot)
  Telegram bot for goal tracking and progress visualization for pairs.  
  Also private at the moment due to active development.

### Access to private work
If you need access to any private repositories or specific code samples, feel free to reach out.

### About this GitHub
Several projects are being migrated from private to public repositories with added documentation, tests, and clearer architecture. More updates will appear soon.
