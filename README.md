# Roman | Java & Python Developer
Java developer focusing on backend systems and practical AI integrations.

### What I'm currently working on
Most of my active work is in private repositories while I’m finalizing structure, documentation and preparing public versions. Current projects include:

- **AI Assistant Bot**  
  Telegram assistant integrating LLM APIs (OpenAI, LangChain).  
  Several features are implemented but not yet pushed while I’m preparing a public-ready structure.

- **Tandem Bot**  
  Telegram bot for goal tracking and progress visualization for pairs.  
  The project is in active development; I’m publishing features gradually as I clean up the codebase.

### About this GitHub
I’m currently moving my work from private repos into public ones, adding documentation, tests, and clearer architecture along the way.  
More updates will appear here soon as I complete the migration.
